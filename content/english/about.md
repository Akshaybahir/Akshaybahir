It's Akshay, I am a software developer in many different front end and back end languages, responsive frameworks, databases, and best code practices. My objective is simply to be the best software developer that I can be and to contribute to the technology industry all that I know and can do. I am dedicated to perfecting my craft by learning from more developers, remaining humble, and continuously making strides to learn all that I can about development. I studied Mathematics, and I believe that my understanding of problem solving and complex algorithms are also skills that have and will continue to contribute to my overall success as a developer.
